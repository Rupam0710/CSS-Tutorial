1. The total width/height is calculated as :

Total height = height + top/bottom padding + top/bottom border + top/bottom margin

2. Shorthand ->clockwise direction

margin : 7px 0px 2px 11px
        top  right bottom left

margin: 7px  6px
       top/bottom  left/right


3. border: 2px solid black
    border width : 3px
    border style : solid
    border color : black    

border radius :9px -> to make the borders rounded 


4. Margin Collapse : When 2 margins from different elements overlap the equivalent margin is te greater of the two.This is called margin collapse.
   
   If there are 2 boxes, 1st box has a margin of 3px and 2nd box has a margin of 7px then the bigger margin will be choosed between them.
   Margin between them is collapsed to the bigger margin. 

5.Box Sizing
  Determines what out of padding and border is included in element's width and height. Can be content-box or border-box.

  .div1{
    box-Sizing:border-box; //The content width and height includes content + padding + border
  }
